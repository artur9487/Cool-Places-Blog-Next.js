It's a Next.js app. The concept of the app is to show a blog of trendy places around the world. The data is received from the GraphCMS through Graph QL query language and server side rendered in the Next.js app. The app consist also of a menu that shows the most commented posts and a menu in which we can filter different categories of specific places. It is also possible to show details about the places and to add personal comments about it.

# Planned development

In the future, the app will have also booking features. The user will be able to store the different places in his travel bucket with his other most liked places. He will be able also to check the nearest aircraft departures, available hotels and the general valuation of all costs.
